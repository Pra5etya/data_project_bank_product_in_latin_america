seniority_in_month -> use max for analysis

histogram -> learn more about and how to analyze (use kde=True, stat='density', avline = median of data, yscale = log)
pada saat membuat histogram pastikan data memiliki setidaknya mean dan std, jika data lebih dari 100,000 maka gunakan log scale pada sumbu x



scatter plot -> learn more about and how to analyze



z-score methode -> learn more about and how to analyze



resample and interpolate -> learn more about and how to analyze


reshape() -> learn more about and how to analyze

Explanation: 
================
The key difference between reshape(-1, 1) and reshape(1, -1) is the shape of the resulting array. 
reshape(-1, 1) results in an array with a single column and multiple rows (a column vector), 
while reshape(1, -1) results in an array with a single row and multiple columns (a row vector).
