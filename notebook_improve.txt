================
The key difference between reshape(-1, 1) and reshape(1, -1) is the shape of the resulting array. 
reshape(-1, 1) results in an array with a single column and multiple rows (a column vector), 
while reshape(1, -1) results in an array with a single row and multiple columns (a row vector).
